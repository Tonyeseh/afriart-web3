            AfriArt is the premier Web3 NFT marketplace dedicated to showcasing and celebrating African art. 
            Built on the Hedera Hashgraph network, we provide a decentralized platform where African artists 
            can mint, showcase, and monetize their creative works as NFTs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our mission is to bridge the gap between traditional African art and the digital world, 
            providing artists with new opportunities to reach global audiences while preserving and 
            promoting African cultural heritage through blockchain technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Features include direct sales, auction bidding, custom artwork commissions through our 
            "Bring2Life" service, and physical art delivery for select pieces.
